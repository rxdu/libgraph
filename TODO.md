# LibGraph Development TODO

## üéØ Current Status

**Test Suite**: 137 tests (43‚Üí137, +218% increase)  
**Architecture**: Major refactoring completed (Edge/Vertex separation, interface/implementation separation)  
**Critical Issues**: 3 implementation bugs discovered and documented  
**State Types**: Full support confirmed for value/pointer/shared_ptr types  

---

## üö® Priority 1: Critical Bug Fixes

### Implementation Issues Discovered Through Testing

1. **Exception Safety in ObtainVertexFromVertexMap** - CRITICAL
   - **Issue**: Memory leak if State constructor throws after `new Vertex(state, state_id)`
   - **Location**: graph_impl.hpp:236
   - **Test**: `MemoryManagementTest.ExceptionDuringVertexAdditionDoesNotLeak` fails

2. **Copy Assignment Operator Vertex Lookup** - HIGH
   - **Issue**: Vertices not findable after assignment due to State copy semantics  
   - **Location**: graph_impl.hpp:87-90
   - **Test**: `MemoryManagementTest.AssignmentOperatorHandlesMemoryCorrectly` fails

3. **Thread Safety** - HIGH (if concurrent use needed)
   - **Issue**: All write operations are NOT thread-safe
   - **Impact**: Race conditions in multi-threaded environments
   - **Status**: Documented unsafe behavior through comprehensive tests

- [ ] Implement hash-based edge lookup instead of linear search
- [ ] Consider using flat_map for small vertex sets

### Algorithm Efficiency
- [ ] Optimize GetAllEdges() to avoid expensive copy (graph_impl.hpp:158-167)
- [ ] Improve RemoveVertex complexity from O(m¬≤)
- [ ] Add early termination to search algorithms

## Known Limitations

- [ ] A* and Dijkstra algorithms assume double type cost (generic costs need proper comparator)
- [ ] Update edges_to and vertices_from data structures for higher efficiency removal  
- [*] Dynamic priority queue improvements needed
- [*] Convenience functions for vertex information access could be added

**Note**: Previous limitations regarding `std::shared_ptr<T>` state types have been **RESOLVED** ‚úÖ
