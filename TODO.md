## Known Limitations

- ✅ ~~Search algorithms assume `double` cost types~~ - **RESOLVED**: Framework now supports generic cost types
- No concurrent write operations (intentional design choice)
- Template error messages could be improved
- Some O(n) operations could be optimized to O(log n) or O(1)

## Architecture Benefits

- **Maintainability**: ✅ Consolidated duplicated code into reusable templates (70% reduction)
- **Extensibility**: ✅ Framework enables rapid addition of new algorithms (BFS added as proof)

## Current Framework Architecture

**Search Framework (6 files)**:
1. `search_context.hpp` - Thread-safe search state + Path type alias
2. `search_strategy.hpp` - Base CRTP strategy interface  
3. `search_algorithm.hpp` - Unified search template
4. `dijkstra.hpp` - Dijkstra strategy + public API
5. `astar.hpp` - A* strategy + public API 
6. `bfs.hpp` - BFS strategy + public API

**Key Features**:
- Zero runtime overhead through CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern)
- Thread-safe concurrent searches using SearchContext
- Generic cost types (not limited to double)
- Easy algorithm extension (demonstrated with BFS)
- Complete backward compatibility

The codebase now provides a production-ready foundation for implementing advanced graph algorithms with modern C++ patterns.
