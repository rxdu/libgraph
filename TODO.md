# LibGraph Improvement TODO List

## ‚úÖ Completed in Latest Session

### Critical Fixes Applied:
1. **Fixed compilation error**: Changed `vertex_id_` to `vertex_id` in search/common.hpp
2. **Removed debug output**: Commented out `std::cout` in graph_impl.hpp:104
3. **Fixed Vertex constructors**: Corrected parameter types from `State&` to `Vertex&`
4. **Fixed iterator invalidation**: 
   - Used `list::remove_if` with value capture in RemoveVertex
   - Used `list::remove` in RemoveEdge for consistency
5. **Prevented infinite loops in ReconstructPath**:
   - Added cycle detection using `unordered_set`
   - Implemented custom Hash and Equal functors for vertex_iterator
   - Added self-loop detection for uninitialized parents
   - Added const `operator->()` to vertex_iterator for hash operations

All 43 unit tests pass successfully after these changes.
