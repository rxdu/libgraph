# LibGraph Improvement TODO List

## ‚úÖ Completed in Latest Session

### Major Refactoring Achievements:
1. **Code Architecture Refactoring** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - **Independent Edge and Vertex Classes**: Moved from nested classes to independent template classes
   - **Separate Header Files**: Created `include/graph/edge.hpp` and `include/graph/vertex.hpp`
   - **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: Used type aliases in Graph class
   - **Fixed Circular Dependencies**: Proper forward declarations and iterator type management
   
2. **Interface/Implementation Separation** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - **Iterator Implementation Moved**: Moved `const_vertex_iterator` and `vertex_iterator` implementations to `graph_impl.hpp`
   - **Clean Header Interface**: `graph.hpp` now contains only declarations
   - **Better Code Organization**: Clear separation between interface and implementation

3. **Modernization Improvements** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - **Modern Type Aliases**: Replaced all `typedef` with `using` declarations
   - **Updated Include Structure**: Reorganized includes with `graph/impl/` path structure
   - **Consistent Naming**: Standardized type naming conventions
   - **Fixed Include Path Consistency**: Standardized all includes to use `graph/impl/` instead of mixed `graph/details/`

### Previous Critical Fixes:
4. **Fixed compilation error**: Changed `vertex_id_` to `vertex_id` in search/common.hpp
5. **Removed debug output**: Commented out `std::cout` in graph_impl.hpp:104
6. **Fixed Vertex constructors**: Corrected parameter types from `State&` to `Vertex&`
7. **Fixed iterator invalidation**: 
   - Used `list::remove_if` with value capture in RemoveVertex
   - Used `list::remove` in RemoveEdge for consistency
8. **Prevented infinite loops in ReconstructPath**:
   - Added cycle detection using `unordered_set`
   - Implemented custom Hash and Equal functors for vertex_iterator
   - Added self-loop detection for uninitialized parents
   - Added const `operator->()` to vertex_iterator for hash operations

All 43 unit tests pass successfully after these changes.

## üü¶ Additional Refactoring Opportunities Identified

### Code Organization Improvements
- [ ] **Move search algorithms to separate files**: Currently AStar and Dijkstra are in `search/` but could benefit from separate `.hpp/.ipp` pattern

### Template Design Improvements  
- [ ] **Extract search algorithm interfaces**: Create common base template for search algorithms
